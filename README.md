**3/28** [John Wixted](https://psychology.ucsd.edu/people/profiles/jwixted.html), is a Distinguished Professor of Psychology at UCSD with research focused on understanding episodic memory. His work investigates the cognitive mechanisms that underlie recognition memory, often drawing upon signal detection theory. He also investigates how episodic memory is represented in the human hippocampus, based mainly on single-unit recording studies performed with epilepsy patients. In recent years, his research has also investigated the applied implications of signal detection-based models of recognition memory and its implications for the reliability of eyewitness memory.

**Emerging Insights into the Reliability of Eyewitness Memory**. Eyewitness misidentifications have contributed to many wrongful convictions. However, despite expressing high confidence at trial, eyewitnesses often make inconclusive misidentifications on the first test conducted early in a police investigation. According to a new scientific consensus, it is important to focus on the results of the first test because, if the perpetrator is not in the lineup, the test itself leaves a memory trace of the innocent suspect in the witness’s brain. Thus, all subsequent tests of the witness’s memory for the same suspect constitute tests of contaminated memory. Unfortunately, when evidence of an initial inconclusive identification is introduced at trial, the rules of evidence provide a witness with an opportunity to explain their prior inconsistent statement. In response, witnesses often provide an opinion about why they did not confidently identify the suspect on the initial test despite doing so now (e.g., “I was nervous on the first test”). However, witnesses lack expertise in—and have no awareness of—the subconscious mechanisms of memory contamination that have been elucidated by decades of scientific research. The combination of a sincerely held (false) memory and a believable (but erroneous) explanation for a prior inconsistent statement is often persuasive to jurors. This is a recipe for a wrongful conviction, one that has been followed many times. These wrongful convictions, which have long been attributed to the unreliability of eyewitness memory, instead reflect a system that unwittingly prioritizes false memories elicited at trial over true memories elicited early in a police investigation. The Federal Rules of Evidence were enacted almost a half-century ago, and it may be time to revisit them in light of the principles of memory that have been established since that time.
